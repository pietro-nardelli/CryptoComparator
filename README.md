# CryptoComparator: A Visual Analytics Environment for Cryptocurrencies Analysis
A data visualization tool for trend analysis and correlations between top 100 cryptocurrencies, implemented with D3.js library and Python (for dimensionality reduction). In the first stage the project was developed for Visual Analytics course at University of Rome, La Sapienza.

Dataset: [top-100-cryptocurrency-historical-data](https://www.kaggle.com/natehenderson/top-100-cryptocurrency-historical-data).

The project is developed by Pietro Manganelli Conforti (manganelliconforti.1754825@studenti.uniroma1.it), Matteo Emanuele (emanuele.1912588@studenti.uniroma1.it), Pietro Nardelli (pietro.nardelli@outlook.com), G. Santucci and M. Angelini.

The data visualization tool is accessible from this [link](https://pietro-nardelli.github.io/CryptoComparator/) (actually PC version only).

The research work can be found in the following short paper on [Eurographics](https://diglib.eg.org/handle/10.2312/eurova20221078). The supplemental material can be found in the latter link or [here](https://pietro-nardelli.github.io/CryptoComparator/Supplemental%20material.pdf).
